            I&apos;m Dom, a self-taught full stack JavaScript/TypeScript
            engineer with a passion for building for the web. With a coffee in
            hand and a love for all things React, Next.js, and NodeJS, I
            experiment across the web ecosystem. Whether I&apos;m architecting
            APIs or crafting pixel-perfect frontends, I strive to strike a
            balance between simple user experience and feature rich interfaces.

            I also wear the hat of a JavaScript teacher, guiding students on
            their coding journeys. I believe that empathy is the secret to
            effective teaching. Having walked the path of a self-learner, I know
            the struggles that beginners face. I&apos;m here to demystify
            complex concepts, and provide a supportive environment where
            everyone feels encouraged to ask questions and embrace their coding
            superpowers.
