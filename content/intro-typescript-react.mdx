```tsx
function BlogPost({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}

<BlogPost title="Coming soon..." />;
```

## Introduction

We cover the essentials you need to start using TypeScript effectively with React. This is not a comprehensive guide and in most (surely all) cases the [TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
provide better and more in-depth explanations.

The goal is to get you using TypeScript in your React projects as painlessly as possible.

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a [superset](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/superset/) of JavaScript. The implication is that any valid JavaScript is valid
TypeScript.

TypeScript is JavaScript **_plus_** the ability to specify types for variables,
function parameters, and more. To quote the TypeScript docs:

> JavaScript provides language primitives like string and number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.

When I first came across TypeScript, I was confused about its exact relationship to JavaScript. Is it a completely separate programming language?
Does it have its own runtime? If you're similarly unsure, the following points might shed some light:

1. TypeScript is an _analysis tool_ that runs _before_ your code. This is what is meant when it is referred to as a [**static**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) typechecker.
2. The analysis results in warnings in your IDE or terminal if types in the program are incorrect.
3. Before execution, TypeScript is [**transpiled**](https://hashnode.com/post/compiling-vs-transpiling-cl0z2hugi0cjhj6nv6pp6a1j3) into JavaScript.
4. Since your code is just JavaScript once it runs, TypeScript has no impact on the runtime behaviour of your code. It will not cause more or different errors
   to be thrown. It only _warns_ you about potential errors while you are authoring your code.

## Setting up your development environment

### Vite

We are going to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as our build tool. It's fast, and supports TypeScript out-of-the-box.

To generate a TypeScript + React template run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts
```

Note that this doesn't download the required node modules. You will need to `cd` into your project directory and `npm install` before trying to start your dev server.

## The basics

### Typing variables

Let's take the simplest case. We have a variable `month`, to which we want to assign the appropriate integer value
for a given month. E.g. `9` for September.

```ts
let month = 9; // September
```

We can imagine that another developer, or our future selves, might be tempted to re-assign this variable like so

```ts
month = 'October';
```

If we intended for `month` to be used in a mathematical operation, we've now got a bug. For example, if we increment month:

```ts
month++; // month is now NaN
Number.isNaN(month) === true; // yep
```

This is legal JavaScript; we'll get no clues as to which code introduced the bug.
We have to execute code in our heads until we identify where we went wrong. JavaScript alone
doesn't **_surface_** the source of the problem.

TypeScript's purpose is to catch bugs like these during the code authoring process, reducing the time and cognitive
load spent on debugging,

Let's re-introduce our `month` variable with TypeScript specific syntax:

```ts
let month: number = 9;
month = 'October';
```

Adding `: number` to the left of the assignment operator explicitly tells TypeScript that `month` should be a number.
When we then try to assign a string to `month` we will immediately get a warning in our IDE. You can experiment with this example
in the [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/PTAEBEFcFNQFwPagORwJ4AdYEsB2AzaAJ2lwGNpkAaUAd1gEMy5IGAbNtUAEwV1VC5o0bqAAqAZQC0AZyxls+bGVAy0uOAwAeofAiIAoEPAAW2GaGhaGAWwxtoAOnETQeQkQtwTsdFlAARgwyIqB8pji42HDY7KDBMtgA5rg2pHAGDnCgNnzeoAC8oACcANwGuRomhSgA8swIAcTI5ZXeANTt5WR8MggOjmwISQAUAHKQNk1EjuZjDGMjbSYAlIUFRXBEMCvlRmAAkvh0sLQMGqGIgbBW9srRoCPRyBYkPTZpuNyhaAiQPHwBLxTOY3LhQL9IERQD1vit9qAsjk8iYAFyCSbTGplBHLGrIeqIaYtIA).

For this example, we didn't need to add extra syntax to get the benefits of type checking.
Whenever possible, TypeScript gets out of our way by using **_type inference_**. The `number` type is inferred
from the initial assignment. In fact, best-practice is **not** to add type annotations when inference is straightforward.

### Getting interesting with objects

As we saw above, TypeScript has no trouble inferring types for simple variables without our help. However, in JavaScript we spend much of our time
working with objects.

We usually have a specific _interface_ in mind for objects we create, even if we are not explicit about it. What properties should the object have? What types are
their values? What operations are permitted on them? Take the following objects, `user1` and `user2`:

```ts
const user1 = {
  name: 'Dom',
  isAdmin: true,
  greeting: 'hello!',
};

const user2 = {
  name: 'Mick',
  greeting(message) {
    console.log(`Hi, ${message}`);
  },
};
```

Now reflect on what the following lines of code evaluate to. Which ones crash our program?
Which won't? Are these helpful outcomes?

```ts
user1.name; // 'Dom'
user1.isAdmin; // true
user1.isAdmin(); // TypeError: user1.isAdmin is not a function
user1.greeting; // 'hello!'
user1.greeting('how are you?'); // TypeError: user1.greeting is not a function
user2.isAdmin; // undefined
user2.greeting; // f greeting()
```

- include demo of array typing, mention any, type inference
- typing function parameters
- contextual typing example with .map - if array element types are known, map doesn&apos;t need to be told
- introduce type and interface including differences / rule of thumb, include optional properties

## Refactor component from JS to TS

- live code refactoring a component to TS

## Some exercises for you to try

1. component refactoring exercise
2. typing children. intro React.PropsWithChildren
3. form submit including types of state and event handlers
4. fetch array of items from API, use TS to specify shape of item objects
5. diving deeper: union and intersection

## Suggested next steps

- unions
- intersections
- generics
