```tsx
function BlogPost({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}

<BlogPost title="Coming soon..." />;
```

## Introduction

We cover the essentials you need to start using TypeScript effectively with React. This is not a comprehensive guide and in most (surely all) cases the [TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
provide better and more in-depth explanations.

The goal is to get you using TypeScript in your React projects as painlessly as possible.

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a [superset](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/superset/) of JavaScript. The implication is that any valid JavaScript is valid
TypeScript.

TypeScript is JavaScript **_plus_** the ability to specify types for variables,
function parameters, and more. To quote the TypeScript docs:

> JavaScript provides language primitives like string and number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.

## Setting up your development environment

We are going to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as our build tool. It's fast, and supports TypeScript out-of-the-box.

To generate a TypeScript + React template run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts
```

Note that this doesn't download the required node modules. You will need to `cd` into your project directory and `npm install` before trying to start your dev server.

## The basics

### Typing variables

Let's take the simplest case. We have a variable `month`, to which we want to assign the appropriate integer value
for a given month. E.g. `9` for September.

```ts
let month = 9; // September
```

We can imagine that another developer, or our future selves, might be tempted to re-assign this variable like so

```ts
month = 'October';
```

If we intended for `month` to be used in a mathematical operation, we've now got a bug. For example, if we increment month:

```ts
month++; // month is now NaN
Number.isNaN(month) === true; // yep
```

This is totally legal JavaScript, and we'll get no clues as to which code introduced the bug.
We have to execute code in our heads until we identify where we went wrong. JavaScript alone
doesn't **_surface_** the source of the problem.

- demo primitive typing with basic variables, include demo of array typing, mention any, type inference
- typing function parameters
- contextual typing example with .map - if array element types are known, map doesn&apos;t need to be told
- introduce type and interface including differences / rule of thumb, include optional properties

## Refactor component from JS to TS

- live code refactoring a component to TS

## Some exercises for you to try

1. component refactoring exercise
2. typing children. intro React.PropsWithChildren
3. form submit including types of state and event handlers
4. fetch array of items from API, use TS to specify shape of item objects
5. diving deeper: union and intersection

## Suggested next steps

- unions
- intersections
- generics
