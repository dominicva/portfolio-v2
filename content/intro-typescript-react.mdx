## Introduction

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a [superset](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/superset/) of JavaScript. The practical implication of this is that any valid JavaScript is valid
TypeScript.

## Setting up your development environment

- Vite

## TypeScript basics for React

- disclaimer: see the intro pages in the TS docs for a better and more in depth explanation of these topics!
- demo primitive typing with basic variables, include demo of array typing, mention any, type inference
- typing function parameters
- contextual typing example with .map - if array element types are known, map doesn&apos;t need to be told
- introduce type and interface including differences / rule of thumb, include optional properties

## Refactor component from JS to TS

- live code refactoring a component to TS

## Some exercises for you to try

1. component refactoring exercise
2. typing children. intro React.PropsWithChildren
3. form submit including types of state and event handlers
4. fetch array of items from API, use TS to specify shape of item objects
5. diving deeper: union and intersection

## Suggested next steps

- unions
- intersections
- generics

```tsx
function BlogPost({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}

<BlogPost title="Coming soon..." />;
```
