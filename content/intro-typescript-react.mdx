## Introduction

We cover the essentials you need to start using TypeScript effectively with React. This is not a comprehensive guide and in most (surely all) cases the [TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
provide better and more in-depth explanations.

The goal is to get you using TypeScript in your React projects as painlessly as possible.

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a [superset](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/superset/) of JavaScript. As a result, any valid JavaScript is valid
TypeScript.

TypeScript is JavaScript **_plus_** the ability to specify types for variables,
functions, and more. To quote the TypeScript docs:

> JavaScript provides language primitives like string and number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.

## Setting up your development environment

- Vite

## TypeScript basics for React

- disclaimer: see the intro pages in the TS docs for a better and more in depth explanation of these topics!
- demo primitive typing with basic variables, include demo of array typing, mention any, type inference
- typing function parameters
- contextual typing example with .map - if array element types are known, map doesn&apos;t need to be told
- introduce type and interface including differences / rule of thumb, include optional properties

## Refactor component from JS to TS

- live code refactoring a component to TS

## Some exercises for you to try

1. component refactoring exercise
2. typing children. intro React.PropsWithChildren
3. form submit including types of state and event handlers
4. fetch array of items from API, use TS to specify shape of item objects
5. diving deeper: union and intersection

## Suggested next steps

- unions
- intersections
- generics

```tsx
function BlogPost({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}

<BlogPost title="Coming soon..." />;
```
