  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}

<BlogPost title="Working on it..." />;
```

## Introduction

We cover the essentials you need to start using TypeScript effectively with React.
This is not a comprehensive TypeScript guide, and in most (surely all) cases, the [TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) provide better and more in-depth explanations.

**The goal is to get you using simple TypeScript in your React projects as painlessly as possible.**

### Pre-requisites

You should already have a solid understanding of JavaScript and React.
Some familiarity with basic TypeScript will also be helpful.

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a [superset](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/superset/) of JavaScript. The implication is that any valid JavaScript is valid
TypeScript.

TypeScript is JavaScript **_plus_** the ability to specify types for variables,
function parameters, and more. To quote the TypeScript docs:

> JavaScript provides language primitives like string and number, but it doesn’t check that you’ve consistently assigned these. TypeScript does.

When I first came across TypeScript, I was confused about its exact relationship to JavaScript. Is it a completely separate programming language?
Does it have its own runtime? If you're similarly unsure, the following points might shed some light:

1. TypeScript is a [**static**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) _analysis tool_, which means that it runs _before_ your code.
2. The analysis results in warnings in your IDE or terminal if types in the program are incorrect.
3. Before execution, TypeScript is [**transpiled**](https://hashnode.com/post/compiling-vs-transpiling-cl0z2hugi0cjhj6nv6pp6a1j3) into JavaScript.
4. Since your code is just JavaScript once it runs, TypeScript has no impact on the runtime behaviour of your code. It will not cause more or different errors
   to be thrown. It only _warns_ you about potential errors while you are authoring your code.

## The basics

### Typing variables

Let's take the simplest case. We have a variable `month`, to which we want to assign the appropriate integer value
for a given month. E.g. `9` for September.

```ts
let month = 9; // September
```

We can imagine that another developer, or our future selves, might be tempted to re-assign this variable like so

```ts
month = 'October';
```

If we intended for `month` to be used in a mathematical operation, we've now got a bug. For example, if we increment month:

```ts
month++; // month is now NaN
Number.isNaN(month) === true; // yep
```

This is legal JavaScript; we'll get no clues as to which code introduced the bug.
We have to execute code in our heads until we identify where we went wrong. JavaScript alone
doesn't **_surface_** the source of the problem.

TypeScript's purpose is to catch bugs like these during the code authoring process, reducing time and cognitive
load spent on debugging,

Let's re-introduce our `month` variable with TypeScript specific syntax:

```ts
let month: number = 9;
month = 'October';
```

Adding `: number` to the left of the assignment operator explicitly tells TypeScript that `month` should be a number.
When we then try to assign a string to `month` we will immediately get a warning in our IDE. You can experiment with this example
in the [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/PTAEBEFcFNQFwPagORwJ4AdYEsB2AzaAJ2lwGNpkAaUAd1gEMy5IGAbNtUAEwV1VC5o0bqAAqAZQC0AZyxls+bGVAy0uOAwAeofAiIAoEPAAW2GaGhaGAWwxtoAOnETQeQkQtwTsdFlAARgwyIqB8pji42HDY7KDBMtgA5rg2pHAGDnCgNnzeoAC8oACcANwGuRomhSgA8swIAcTI5ZXeANTt5WR8MggOjmwISQAUAHKQNk1EjuZjDGMjbSYAlIUFRXBEMCvlRmAAkvh0sLQMGqGIgbBW9srRoCPRyBYkPTZpuNyhaAiQPHwBLxTOY3LhQL9IERQD1vit9qAsjk8iYAFyCSbTGplBHLGrIeqIaYtIA).

For this example, we didn't need to add extra syntax to get the benefits of type checking.
Whenever possible, TypeScript gets out of our way by using what is called **_type inference_**, inferring the type from the initial assignment.
Best-practice is to avoid adding type annotations when inference is straightforward.

### Getting interesting with objects

As we saw above, TypeScript has no trouble inferring types for simple variables without our help. However, in JavaScript we spend much of our time
working with objects.

We usually have a specific _interface_ in mind for objects we create, even if we are not explicit about it. What properties should the object have? What types are
their values? What operations are permitted on them? Take the following objects, `user1` and `user2`:

```ts
const user1 = {
  name: 'Dom',
  isAdmin: true,
  greeting: 'hello!',
  birthday: 694224000000,
};

const user2 = {
  name: 'Mick',
  greeting(message) {
    console.log(`Hi, ${message}`);
  },
  birthday: '1999-02-04',
};
```

Now reflect on what the following lines of code evaluate to. Which ones crash our program?
Which won't? Are these helpful outcomes?

```ts
user1.isAdmin; // true
user2.isAdmin; // undefined
user1.isAdmin(); // TypeError: user1.isAdmin is not a function

user1.greeting; // 'hello!'
user2.greeting; // f greeting()

user1.birthday - user2.birthday; // NaN
```

- **`user2.isAdmin`:** accessing properties that don't exist is legal JavaScript. You get `undefined`.
  Have we forgotten to assign a value? Is the value intentionally undefined? It seems harmless, but what
  if you're passing this data to a database? What type of data does the `isAdmin` column expect?
  Getting this wrong _will_ cause bugs.

- **`user2.isAdmin()`:** it would be reasonable if `.isAdmin()` were a method, particularly if it involves reading
  from a database or user session. The error message is descriptive, making it easier to identify the source of the issue. Nevertheless,
  it would be nice to avoid mistakes like this altogether.

- **`user2.greeting`:** we get a reference to the `.greeting()` method. Let's say we tried this:

  ```ts
  // assuming this exists on our web page
  const h2 = document.querySelector('h2');

  if (user2.greeting) {
    h2.textContent = greeting;
  } else {
    h2.textContent = 'Hi there!';
  }
  ```

  Now we're displaying a function signature in our UI! I actually saw this happen on a payment confirmation page recently.

- **`user1.birthday - user2.birthday`:** calculating the time between dates is a common
  task. Without knowing their types we have to search our code for the source of `NaN`.

### Specifying types for the user object

Here is the syntax for declaring a custom type and declaring that an object instance should conform to it:

```ts
type UserProps = {
  name: string;
  greeting: string;
  birthday: number;
  isAdmin: boolean;
};

const user1: UserProps = {
  name: 'Dom',
  isAdmin: true,
  greeting: 'hello!',
  birthday: 694224000000,
};
```

You can experiment with this example in the [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#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).
The syntax looks a lot like a regular JavaScript object, except types take the place of values.
Note the semi-colons separating properties. This is common practice, but commas are also valid.

**The workflow of declaring a custom type and specifying that a variable should conform to it
is exactly how we will type component props in React.**

### Typing arrays

We want to add a `posts` property to our user object. `posts` should be an array where each element is an object
containing data related to a user's blog post. Let's expand our example to reflect this. You can experiment with this
example in the [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBACg9gZ2DATnMCoF4oG8BQUUwAlsADYQBcUSKJAdgOYDchUAhgK7AAWcKGnUat2YLgCNyJBLwgATAPIMhweszYBfNvlCQoAVQQQUqdJhwEiDDgFtqtNSLZEZAQXm3GNCXDiUOBhcoJhQICFJmVXVRIgkSFD55DhAaBi5bCRNgsERgBBp4JDMMAG0AXS0dAGM4BiQoLmMUAEYaIxMSizx2G3saAHIAEThbAYAadndPb2IULghJolDwyKZBuXJyOABCCfZ4xN5k1KgANgBOABYAJhurgAYn56WoXKQCqFL2Iisif9IFAcAwA4hE1o4OIkFFAAO5kXhQAAq4AgAGVqvQwMAoIwoAAlCAcarAfb-f7cPgCQYjLwMEjVKAAN0CUDc5FsCAZAGsyeS3pJpLIFMpBjcHjcAMwAWgeF2lLSufKImlevx+ALIlEGACEuCRyPJOFBagx5GQSHUOFsQFAAGYCWwcYDAGHVa0QM1Q3EMAlEknKik8fiCKDDUaMBnM1nszk8wNEcRSGRyJQqMPiqUKh4Km4JjWq9jlSbaIA).

```ts
type PostProps = {
  title: string;
  author: string;
  publishedOn: string;
};

type UserProps = {
  name: string;
  isAdmin: boolean;
  greeting: string;
  birthday: number;
  posts: PostProps[];
};

const user1: UserProps = {
  name: 'Dom',
  isAdmin: true,
  greeting: 'hello!',
  birthday: 694224000000,
  posts: [
    {
      title: 'Getting started with TypeScript in React',
      author: 'Dominic van Almsick',
      publishedOn: '2023-09-14',
    },
    {
      title: 'Build a conditionally formatted calendar in React',
      author: 'Dominic van Almsick',
      publishedOn: '2023-10-12',
    },
  ],
};
```

What have we added here?

- A custom type `PostProps` specifying the properties and types that post objects should have
- We have added a `posts` field to `UserProps`
- the syntax `posts: PostProps[];` should be read as:
  > the value for the posts property should be an array where each element is of type PostProps

The syntax for an array is the `[]` square brackets after the type name. In this example we used a custom
type. If we were specifying arrays of primitives the syntax would be:

```ts
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
const strings: string[] = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
const bools: boolean[] = [true, false, false];
// etc.
```

### Optional properties

We might want to specify that an object property or function parameter is optional.
Sometimes it will be there, other times not. We can achieve this by including a question mark `?` before the colon `:`.
in the type declaration. For example

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  nickname?: string;
};

const person1: Person = {
  name: 'Dom',
};

const person2: Person = {
  name: 'Michael',
  nickname: 'Mickey',
};
```

TypeScript will give us an error if we try to access a method on the `nickname` property
unless we guard against it possibly being undefined

```ts
// TypeScript won't like this
person1.nickname.toUpperCase();

// This will make it happy
person1.nickname?.toUpperCase();
```

This is really helpful for avoiding the dreaded `Cannot read properties of undefined` error!

### Typing functions

When it comes to functions there are two pieces of type information to consider

1. the types of the function's **parameters**
2. the type of the function's **return value**

Let's get straight to an example, incorporating the concepts we have covered so far.
Consider the following function, `getWordsFromString`, which accepts a string of text as input,
and returns an array where each element is a word from the original string. For simplicity we will only
cover separating on a single space.

```ts
function getWordsFromString(text: string): string[] {
  return text.split(' ');
}
```

- for parameters, we include the type information within the parentheses.
- for the return value, we include the type information after the parentheses, preceded
  by a colon.

This level of detail will get us a long way in terms of typing React components.
Typing functions does go much deeper though. Here's a [link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html)
to the relevant section of the docs if you're keen to learn more.

This is helpful because if we try to access the `age` property on a `Person`, TypeScript will give us an error if we don't
check whether `age` is

## Our mini project

Let's get ready to write some React.

We are going to create a list of countries and data associated with them.
Each country has its own card in the UI. Clone this [repo](https://github.com/dominicva/intro-ts-react.git) to get the starter code.
The repo has two branches: `main` and `solution`. We'll be working through the exercise on the main branch.

### Inspecting the project

Once you've opened up the repo in VSCode and run `npm install`, run `npm run dev` to start the local dev server.

We've got the usual suspects in a boilerplate React app. For simplicity I've kept all of the code inside `App.tsx`,
and you won't have to worry about styling at all. Here's the contents of `App.tsx`

```jsx
import './App.css';
import countries from './countries.json';

function CountryCard({ name, continents, population, capital, flags }) {
  return (
    <article className="country">
      <img src={flags.svg} alt={flags.alt} className="country__flag" />
      <div className="country__text-content">
        <hgroup>
          <h2 className="country__name">{name}</h2>
          <h3 className="country__continent">{continents[0]}</h3>
        </hgroup>
        <div className="country__info-container">
          <p className="country__info">
            <span className="country__label">Capital city</span>
            <span className="country__value">{capital}</span>
          </p>
          <p className="country__info">
            <span className="country__label">Population</span>
            <span className="country__value">
              {population.toLocaleString()}
            </span>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </article>
  );
}

function CountriesList({ countries }) {
  return (
    <ul className="countries">
      {countries.map(country => (
        <li key={country.name}>
          <CountryCard {...country} />
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1 className="main__heading">Countries Of the World</h1>
      <CountriesList countries={countries} />
    </main>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**This is pure JavaScript. For the exercise, we will refactor
to add TypeScript-specific features.**

Also for your reference here's the json data that we're importing on line 2.
The data is based on a response from the [REST countries API](https://restcountries.com/).

]
```

Now open the app in a browser window and see what we get... blank screen? Check the console.

```sh
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLocaleString')
```

Classic.

Can you find the source of the bug?

## Setting up your development environment

### Vite

We are going to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as our build tool. It's fast, and supports TypeScript out-of-the-box.

To generate a TypeScript + React template run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts
```

Note that this doesn't download the required node modules. You will need to `cd` into your project directory and `npm install` before trying to start your dev server.

- typing function parameters
- contextual typing example with .map - if array element types are known, map doesn&apos;t need to be told
- introduce type and interface including differences / rule of thumb, include optional properties

## Refactor component from JS to TS

- live code refactoring a component to TS

## Some exercises for you to try

1. component refactoring exercise
2. typing children. intro React.PropsWithChildren
3. form submit including types of state and event handlers
4. fetch array of items from API, use TS to specify shape of item objects
5. diving deeper: union and intersection

## Suggested next steps

- unions
- intersections
- generics
